                    <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
Smartphones have become an integral part of people’s everyday lives. Smartphones are used across all household locations, including in the bed at night. Smartphone screens and other displays emit blue light, and exposure to blue light can
affect one’s sleep quality. Thus, smartphone use prior to bedtime could disrupt the quality of one’s sleep, but research lacks
quantitative studies on how smartphone use can influence sleep. This study combines smartphone application use data from
75 participants with sleep data collected by a wearable ring. On average, the participants used their smartphones in bed for
322.8 s (5 min and 22.8 s), with an IQR of 43.7–456. Participants spent an average of 42% of their time in bed using their
smartphones (IQR of 5.87–55.5%). Our findings indicate that smartphone use in bed has significant adverse effects on sleep
latency, awake time, average heart rate, and HR variability. We also find that smartphone use does not decrease sleep quality
when used outside of bed. Our results indicate that intense smartphone use alone does not negatively affect well-being. Since
all smartphone users do not use their phones in the same way, extending the investigation to different smartphone use types
might yield more information than general smartphone use. In conclusion, this paper presents the first investigation of the
association between smartphone application use logs and detailed sleep metrics. Our work also validates previous research
results and highlights emerging future work.

                    <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
The adoption of Mobile Health (mHealth) for self-management is growing. mHealth solutions
are commonly used in public healthcare and health services, where they are appreciated for
their ease of use, broad reach, and wide acceptance. Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is one
of the most common health problems and a leading cause of disability. As such, it imposes a
tremendous burden on patients and society. Studies have proposed that mHealth self-management
solutions, such as mobile applications, can supplement traditional care methods and benefit
patients, particularly in self-managing CLBP easier. To this end, the number of available mobile
applications for CLBP has increased. This paper i) provides an overview of scientific studies on
mobile applications for CLBP management from three different viewpoints: researchers, health
professionals, and patients, ii) uncovers the application features that were seen as beneficial in
the studies, and iii) contrasts the currently available applications for CLBP in Google Play Store
and Apple App Store against the discovered features. The findings show that “Personalization
and customization” is the most significant feature as it is beneficial from stakeholders’ viewpoint
and is represented by most applications. In contrast, “Gamification” and “Artificial intelligence”
are the least significant features, indicating a lack of attention from application creators and
researchers in this area.

                    <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
A new generation of wearable devices now enables end-users to keep track of their sleep patterns. This paper
reports on a longitudinal study of 82 participants who used a state-of-the-art sleep-tracking ring for an
average of 65 days. We conducted interviews and questionnaires to understand changes to their lifestyle, their
perceptions of the tracked information and sleep, and the overall experience of using an unobtrusive sleep-tracking device. Our results indicate that such a device is suitable for long-term sleep tracking and helpful in
identifying detrimental lifestyle elements that hinder sleep quality. However, tracking one’s sleep can also
introduce stress or physical discomfort, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. We discuss these findings in
light of related work and highlight the near-term research directions that the rapid commoditisation of sleep-tracking technology enables.

                    <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
Public controversies around the unethical use of personal data are increasing, spotlighting data ethics as an increasingly important field of study. 
MyData is a related emerging vision that emphasizes individuals’ control of their personal data. In this paper, we investigate people’s perceptions of various data management scenarios
by measuring the perceived ethicality and level of felt concern concerning the scenarios. We deployed a set of 96 unique scenarios
to an online crowdsourcing platform for assessment and invited a representative sample of the participants to a second-stage questionnaire about the MyData vision and its potential in the feld of
healthcare. Our results provide a timely investigation into how topical data-related practices affect the perceived ethicality and the felt concern.
The questionnaire analysis reveals great potential in the MyData vision. Through the combined quantitative and qualitative results, 
                        we contribute to the field of data ethics.

                    <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
This paper reports on a summative analysis of Exploratory Reading Groups (ERGs), a low time-commitment, relational, student-led reading group program designed to provide students from any background and year with a broad exploration of computing research. Since prior work, the program was institutionalized as a 1-credit course with a greater emphasis on strengthening pipelines into research labs.
                        In analyzing 3 quarters of data from 136 participants, we found diverse indicators of impact. 
                        Surprisingly, despite the lightweight nature of the program (∼ 2 hours/week), we observed a statistically significant increase in satisfaction with their intellectual development at the university;
                        confidence in reading, presenting, and communicating about their field; sense of belonging for women and minoritized ethnic groups; alignment with faculty goals in joining research labs (greater desire to make a research contribution and publish,
                        decreased desire to join for the purpose of exploration); and engagement in the ‘reconsideration’ dimension of career identity formation. Over 70% of the participants continued on into group research projects for undergraduate students. 
                        The effectiveness of this scalable, lightweight initiative shows the promise of ERGs as a tool to support students in computing when connected to group research projects and points to future research directions on designing other lightweight, relational, scalable learning experiences.

                    <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
Sedentary behavior is endemic in modern workplaces, contributing to negative physical and mental health outcomes. 
Although adjustable standing desks are increasing in popularity, people still avoid standing.
We developed an open-source plug-and-play system to remotely control standing desks and investigated three system modes with a three-week in-the-wild user study N=15.
Interval mode forces users to stand once per hour, causing frustration. Adaptive mode nudges users to stand every hour unless the user has stood already. 
Smart mode, which raises the desk during breaks, was the best rated, contributing to increased standing time with the most positive qualitative feedback. 
However, non-computer activities need to be accounted for in the future. 
Therefore, our results indicate that a smart standing desk that shifts modes at opportune times has the most potential to reduce sedentary behavior in the workplace.
We contribute our open-source system and insights for future intelligent workplace well-being systems.
